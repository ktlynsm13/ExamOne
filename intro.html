                <p>One of our first assignments that we had to do was our intorduction project. This was the first time I ever did something like what this class asks so I was nervous to do it. I struggled to get it turned in but that was the only thing I was struggling with.</p>

                <p>Below I have added the link that we had to turn in for that project. This is what the first final project looked like when we first started this class.</p>
