                <p>There is another project that we continue to work on which is called the Forward Fitness Club. This is the workbook website that were building as we're working through the chapters in the workbook. As time goes on there will be more stuff added to this website but as of now this is as far as we've gotten on it</p>

                <p>Below I have linked what we have finished on this webiste. There's a couple of different things in the Forward Fitness Club website that I don't include in this website since it just doesn't call for them.</p>
