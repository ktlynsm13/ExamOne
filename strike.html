                <p>Another assignment that we did was one called Strike A Chord. This doesn't show as many links as the Forward Fitness Club website but this shows how we were learning to add navigation headings to a webpage.</p>

                <p>Below I have linked the website that I turned in to my teacher. This will show you what we did for this webpage.</p>
